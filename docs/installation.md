    ```bash
    brew install python-tk
    ```

- On **Linux** (Debian/Ubuntu):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

- On **Linux** (Arch):

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S tk
    ```

- On **Windows**, `tkinter` is usually included with the standard Python installer. If you encounter issues, ensure you installed Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
